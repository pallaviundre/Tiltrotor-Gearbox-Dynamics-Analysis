# Tiltrotor-Gearbox-Dynamics-Analysis
MATLAB-based modeling and simulation of a tiltrotor aircraft gearbox, including nonlinear damping and cubic friction effects.

OVERVIEW :
This project models and simulates the dynamic behavior of a tiltrotor aircraft gearbox using MATLAB. The model includes nonlinear damping and cubic friction effects. The system is also linearized, and transfer functions are obtained to compare nonlinear and linear system responses.

OBJECTIVE :
1.Model gearbox dynamics considering real-world nonlinearities.
2.Apply linearization techniques for simplified analysis.
3.Compare linear and nonlinear time-domain responses.

METHODS USED:
1.MATLAB/Simulink modeling
2.Nonlinear system simulation
3.Linearization via state-space representation
4.Transfer function derivation

RESULT :
1.Nonlinear vs. linear model performance compared across multiple input cases.
2.Identified conditions where linear models closely match nonlinear behavior.
